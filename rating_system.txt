Rating System:
Student Ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5, where:
Rate 5 = 70%
Rate 4 = 55%
Rate 3 = 40%
Rate 2 = 25%
Rate 1 = 10%
Teacher’s Remark has two options:
Implemented = 30%
Not Implemented = 0%
System's Interpretation:
If students rate 5 (70%) and the teacher marks "Implemented" (30%), it equals 100%, and the system interprets this as "Implemented."
If students rate 1 (10%) and the teacher marks "Implemented" (30%), it equals 40%, and the system interprets this as "Not Implemented."
If students rate 2 (25%) and the teacher marks "Implemented" (30%), it equals 55%, and the system interprets this as "Not Implemented."
Formulas:
To calculate the overall rating of all students:
Total Rate / Total Students = Student Ratings
To calculate the system’s interpretation:
Student Ratings + Teacher’s Remark = System’s Interpretation
Example Calculation:
If five students provide ratings:

Student 1: 10% (Rate 1)
Student 2: 25% (Rate 2)
Student 3: 40% (Rate 3)
Student 4: 55% (Rate 4)
Student 5: 70% (Rate 5)
The total rating is 200%. Divided by 5 students:

200% / 5 = 40% (Overall Student Rating)
Add the teacher's remark of 30% (Implemented):
40% + 30% = 70%
Interpretation:
The final system interpretation is 70%, which means "Implemented."
Thresholds:
56% or above = Implemented
55% or below = Not Implemented
This framework allows for a combined evaluation based on both student feedback and teacher input.
